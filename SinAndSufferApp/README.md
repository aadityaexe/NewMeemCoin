# 🔥 Sin & Suffer

**Sin & Suffer** is a dark, mythological web experience built with React — where each click, each question, each thought is judged in the abyss. Inspired by Hindu concepts of karma and punishment, this site leads users through a twisted, poetic confession booth that reveals their deepest sins... and the horrors they must endure in Hell.

## 🕳️ Welcome to the Abyss

> “Every desire is a spark. Every betrayal, a flame. In the halls of Naraka, even your thoughts burn.”
